📌 Introduction
===
Hello, my name is Yu-Xiang. I graduated from Kun Shan University with a degree in Computer Science and Information Engineering, and I also completed my high school studies in Information Technology at Chang Jung High School. Throughout my academic journey, I built a solid foundation in software development, and I'm passionate about applying my skills to real-world projects through both teaching and hands-on experience.

After graduation, I served as a part-time instructor at my high school, teaching Arduino programming and IoT sensor applications. This role enhanced my communication and instructional skills. I also completed two internships at Bread of Life Church in Tainan, where I maintained and updated the official websites for both the church and seminary. During these experiences, I worked with front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), back-end development (PHP), and databases (MySQL, MSSQL), gaining practical full-stack development experience.

I am optimistic, responsible, and patient. I enjoy collaborating with teams and am always eager to learn new technologies to improve my capabilities. I believe that technical skills are important, but a positive attitude and continuous learning are key to long-term success. I hope to contribute my skills to your team as a software engineer, whether in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development, and grow together with the company.
